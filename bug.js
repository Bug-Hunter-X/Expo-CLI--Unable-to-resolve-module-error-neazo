This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that Expo doesn't support or that's not properly installed in your project.  The exact error message might point to a specific module, but the root cause is often a missing or incompatible dependency.  Sometimes, even if a module *appears* to be installed (`npm ls` shows it), issues with package resolution or linking can still cause this error.
