Several solutions exist depending on the root cause:

1. **Verify Module Support:** Check if the module is compatible with Expo.  Many modules designed for React Native might not work seamlessly in Expo's managed workflow.

2. **Check Installation:** Ensure the module is correctly installed:
    - `expo install <module_name>`

3. **Clear and Rebuild:** Sometimes, cached build artifacts cause problems. Try clearing the cache and reinstalling dependencies:
    - `expo start --clear`

4. **Review Package.json:** Ensure the module is listed correctly as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

5. **Expo Go vs. Build:**  The error may be specific to Expo Go. Test on a standalone build to rule out any emulator-related issues.

6. **Linking (Bare Workflow Only):** If you are using Expo's bare workflow, ensure that the module is properly linked using the necessary steps outlined in its documentation.

7. **Correct Imports:** Double-check the import path within your `bug.js` file to ensure it is accurate and points to the correct location of the module.

Example: If you were trying to import `react-native-maps`, ensure it's installed correctly and import correctly.  Incorrect import might be:
`import MapView from 'react-native-maps';`
Ensure your import statement accurately reflects your project's structure.
